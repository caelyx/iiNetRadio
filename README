iiNet Radio 

iiNet provides unmetered access to an icecast server hosted inside their 
network.  This server proxies many popular internet streaming radio stations.  

While I really enjoy making use of this service, I don't particularly want to 
have to use a GUI client to do so. mpg321 is an excellent command-line client, 
but I can't remember the available streams' URLs.  I wanted an easier way of 
invoking mpg321 than copy-pasting the URLs out of a text file; this script is 
it. 

This script is terribly rudimentary, but it meets my immediate needs. If it's 
useful to you, I'd love to hear about it.
